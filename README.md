The files provided in this repository are as follows:
The "EcoApp2025pubCode.R" is the Rscript used to build indices, test indices, and validate results for this study. 
The "EcoApp25SBI.R" is the script used for the salt belt index case study
Data needed to run code are in "Data.for.EcoApp25.xlsx" and "EcoApp25Data.xlsx".



The "AssemblyMechanismsByTaxa.xlsx" file contains the quantified values of niche breadth, species interactions, and dispersal (SFP) for each taxon.
The "DataUsedToBuildTestIndices.xlsx" file contains the compiled data from OCC (build) and EPA NRSA (test). The "build" sheet was additionally used to quantify niche breadth and species interactions.
The "Indexscores-with-assembly-mechanisms.xlsx" file contains the index scores associated with each taxon, with the grouping assigned based on each respective assembly mechanism.
